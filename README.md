# Sudoku-Android-Project
Android Studio Project of Sudoku.

An app that has 3 different sudoku you can try to complete. It saves your score in an SQLite database and retrieves it
when you open the app, showing you the 3 top scores, with the name of whom scored it.
It also lets you create a Calendar event once you complete a game, so that you can save the date in which you completed
that game and its score.
It also has a WebView as a help page, which you can access through the toolbar menu.
